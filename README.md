# Blue-Team-Analysis

> **Built to Learn. Built to Investigate. Preparing to defend.**

## 🔵 Blue Team Analysis Repository — Overview

This repository documents my hands-on learning and practical analysis across core Blue Team and SOC domains, with a focus on developing real-world defensive skills used in modern security operations. The purpose of this repository is to practice, document, and refine SOC-level investigation techniques through structured analysis, repeatable workflows, and clear documentation. Each section reflects how security analysts think, investigate, and respond to threats in operational environments.

## Focus Areas Covered

- [Phishing Analysis](https://github.com/rishi-blueteam/blue-team-analysis/tree/b395fb62c17a39db2331f9d6335e1c149906a8d0/Phishing%20Analysis)
- Network Traffic Analysis

I also aim to cover other key areas where my interest goes along with tools, use cases and exploring other key blue team areas.

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

This repository is built with the belief that strong defense comes from clarity and repetition. The goal is not tool memorization, but:
- Understanding why an alert triggers
- Knowing how to investigate efficiently
- Documenting findings clearly and professionally

All analysis is documented to reflect SOC-ready thinking, with a focus on improving investigative depth, accuracy, and confidence over time.

## 📌 Intended Outcome

By continuously expanding and refining this repository, the aim is to:
- Build a solid Blue Team skill foundation
- Explore and understand concepts fundamentally
- Demonstrate practical SOC capabilities
- Develop disciplined investigation habits
- Grow toward roles such as SOC Analyst and Digital Forensics Incident Response professional
