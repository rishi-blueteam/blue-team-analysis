## Scenario Summary

Another Practice file for learning about the EK activity taken place in a scenario when an incident was raised. A new file, means a new exploit, the methodlogy remains the same but detection becomes key, the detection becomes smarter, finding the exploit and finding the right way to note down IOC matters a lot too.

## Key Takeaways \& Learning**


Focus on practicing and identifying, where you are wrong. It is essential to learn how to do, and then imply how to extract. You cannot extract what you don't know and this begins not only with mastering a single tool it goes on to mastering various tools in your workshop of weapons to use in cases where you have to master. 



**Words of Self Wisdom** 

- In the process of preparing my certification, I didn't focus at all on the Wireshark Practical analysis. After I have passed my  certification AZ-900. I decided to come and focus on where I left off. To put the focus back on the Wireshark Practical analysis made me realize that I forgot most of the filters, and the way to properly analyze. This is about pure dedication and practice. One day off can make you feel lack a lot. If you do not practice it straight up.
